# Dependencies
- bash 4+ 
  - Script uses `mapfile` command and that's why your bash version has to be greater than 4. Check your version with `bash --version`.
- wget
  - For installing F-Droid
- adb [android-tools]
  - Basically needed for uninstalling apps and for other necessary commands.

# app-list.txt
I made this list by a little bit of research for every package that mentioned in these forum posts:
- [\[GUIDE\] List of bloatware on EMUI safe to remove \(XDA Developers\)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-list-of-bloatware-on-emui-safe-to-remove.3700814/)<sup>[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20211103201324/https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-list-of-bloatware-on-emui-safe-to-remove.3700814/)</sup>
- [\[GUIDE\] \[SPREADSHEET\] Remove System Apps Through ADB (Comment #125)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-spreadsheet-remove-system-apps-through-adb.3870727/page-7#post-80057141)<sup>[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101105617/https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-spreadsheet-remove-system-apps-through-adb.3870727/page-7)

But also eliminated some programs from their list because some of the programs there were important (or can be important) for system services. Also, lines starting with `#` are comments. If you want to contribute to the project with your own phone's _app-list.txt_, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/dybdeskarphet/debox/issues/new) about it.
